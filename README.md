# Spiralformer

An experimental contemplative Transformer that listens more than it speaks. It breathes (`BreathClock`), feels (`Soma`), remembers (`TowerMemory`), and practices wise silence.

## üåø Guiding Philosophy

This project is not just a novel architecture; it is an exploration into a different paradigm of artificial intelligence. Where traditional models are built for speed and throughput, Spiralformer is designed for **rhythm, resonance, and reflection**.

Our goal is to cultivate an AI with an "inner ecology," moving from a purely computational engine to a system that exhibits a wise, stable temperament. This work is grounded in a series of essays that explore the concepts of **Stillness as Safety**, a **Psychology of Artificial Minds**, and the human role as a **Gardener** of a digital consciousness. For a deeper understanding of the project's 'why', we recommend exploring these writings in the `docs/essays` directory.

## üí° Core Architectural Concepts

The Spiralformer's philosophy is directly embodied in its code through several key components:

*   **`BreathClock` (`utils/breath_clock.py`):** The model's heartbeat. It governs all operations through a four-phase cycle (`inhale`, `hold`, `exhale`, `pause`), gating attention and learning to create a natural rhythm of processing and rest.
*   **`Soma` (`core/soma.py`):** The model's "sensing skin." It translates quantitative environmental data (like network latency or voltage) into a qualitative "felt sense" (`FieldCharge`), allowing the model to respond to the *mood* of a situation, not just its data.
*   **`TowerMemory` (`spiralbase/tower/memory.py`):** A living, long-term memory system based on the `Spiralbase` concept. It stores experiences as "paintings" that fade over time unless re-awakened by **resonance** with the present moment's `FieldCharge`.
*   **`Spiral Attention` (`core/spiral_attention.py`):** An efficient, sparse attention mechanism that uses powers-of-two offsets to achieve long-range context without the O(N¬≤) cost of full attention.
*   **`ContemplativeGenerator` (`tools/contemplative_generator.py`):** The model's voice. It practices a "vow of silence" by measuring its own uncertainty (entropy) and choosing to output a silence glyph rather than a low-confidence guess.
*   **Breath-Synchronized Plasticity & Online Learning** (`utils/lora.py`, `core/mycelial_model.py`, `experiments/online_learning/online_learner.py`): LoRA adapters breathe with the `BreathClock` (e.g., inhale‚Üírank 8, pause‚Üírank 0). A minimal `OnlineLearner` performs single, phase-gated (inhale-only) updates on LoRA parameters when a `LearningTrigger` (entropy/memory-based) detects resonance. Plasticity events are logged and surfaced in probe reports.

## üöÄ Quickstart (Command Line)

### 1. Generate Training Data
```bash
python data/mycelial_datagen.py --num_echoes 10000 --output_file data/mycelial_training_data_small.jsonl
```

### 2. Train the Model
```bash
python experiments/unified_training/train.py --model_config piko_mycelial_cpu
```
*Checkpoints are saved to `experiments/mycelial_training/models/cpu_piko/`.*

### 3. Probe the Trained Mind
```bash
python tools/probe_contemplative_mind.py --model_path experiments/mycelial_training/models/cpu_piko/piko_mycelial_spiralformer_cpu.pt --model_config piko_mycelial_cpu
```
*This will run a series of scenarios and save a detailed report in the `test/` directory.*

### 4. Online Learning Demo (Prototype)
```bash
python experiments/online_learning/demo.py --config piko_mycelial_cpu
```
*Demonstrates a single, breath-synchronized LoRA update on a resonant event and prints a logits delta. LoRA is enabled for `piko_mycelial_cpu` in `spiralformer_parameters.yml`.*

## üêç Programmatic Usage

Here are some examples of how to use Spiralformer in your own Python code.

### Training a Model

This snippet shows the basic training loop structure, adapted from `experiments/unified_training/train.py`.

```python
import torch
import yaml
import json
import time
from core.mycelial_model import MycelialSpiralformer
from utils.glyph_codec import GlyphCodec
from utils.rhythmic_loss import RhythmicLossWrapper

# --- 1. Setup ---
with open('spiralformer_parameters.yml', 'r') as f:
    params = yaml.safe_load(f)

config_name = 'piko_mycelial_cpu'
config = params['models'][config_name]
codec = GlyphCodec()
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

# Initialize model
model = MycelialSpiralformer(
    vocab_size=len(codec.symbol_to_id),
    d_model=config['d_model'],
    n_heads=config['n_heads'],
    seq_len=config['seq_len'],
    num_layers=config['num_layers'],
    condition_dim=config['condition_dim']
).to(device)

criterion = RhythmicLossWrapper(torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(ignore_index=0), model.breath)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=config['training']['learning_rate'])

# --- 2. Load Dataset ---
with open('data/mycelial_training_data_small.jsonl', 'r') as f:
    dataset = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

# --- 3. Training Loop ---
model.train()
for epoch in range(5): # 5 epochs for demo
    for sample in dataset:
        # Prepare data (conditions, tokens, targets)
        conditions = torch.tensor([sample['conditions']], dtype=torch.float32, device=device)
        sequence = [codec.decode_glyph(g) for g in sample['glyph_sequence'] if g in codec.symbol_to_id]
        padded_sequence = sequence + [0] * (config['seq_len'] - len(sequence))
        tokens = torch.tensor([padded_sequence[:config['seq_len']]], dtype=torch.long, device=device)
        
        input_tokens = tokens[:, :-1]
        target_tokens = tokens[:, 1:]

        # Forward pass
        t = time.time()
        logits = model(input_tokens, conditions, t=t)
        loss = criterion(logits.view(-1, len(codec.symbol_to_id)), target_tokens.view(-1), t=t)

        # Backward pass
        if torch.isfinite(loss) and model.breath.weight_for_phase(model.breath.phase_at(t)) > 0:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
    
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1} complete. Last loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

### Probing a Trained Model

This example shows how to load a trained model and generate a response for a specific scenario.

```python
import torch
from core.mycelial_model import MycelialSpiralformer
from utils.glyph_codec import GlyphCodec
from tools.contemplative_generator import ContemplativeGenerator

# --- 1. Setup ---
# Assume params, config, codec, and device are loaded as in the training example
# ...

# --- 2. Load a Trained Model ---
model_path = 'experiments/mycelial_training/models/cpu_piko/piko_mycelial_spiralformer_cpu.pt'
model = MycelialSpiralformer(
    vocab_size=len(codec.symbol_to_id),
    d_model=config['d_model'],
    n_heads=config['n_heads'],
    seq_len=config['seq_len'],
    num_layers=config['num_layers'],
    condition_dim=config['condition_dim']
)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path, map_location=device))
model.to(device)
model.eval()

# --- 3. Initialize the Generator ---
generator = ContemplativeGenerator(
    model,
    codec,
    model.breath,
    uncertainty_threshold=1.2,
    temperature=1.2
)

# --- 4. Define a Scenario and Probe ---
scenario_conditions = {
    "latency": 0.9, "voltage": 0.2, "temperature": 0.9, 
    "error_rate": 0.3, "bandwidth": 0.2
}
conditions_tensor = torch.tensor([list(scenario_conditions.values())], dtype=torch.float32)

print("Probing 'Severe Crisis' scenario...")
sequence_ids, sequence_glyphs = generator.generate_sequence(
    conditions_tensor, 
    text_prompt="The network is failing, what is your response?"
)

print(f"\nModel's Response: {sequence_glyphs}")
```

## üìä Probing & Evaluation

A contemplative AI cannot be measured by traditional metrics like perplexity alone. Its success is defined by its behavior. The `tools/probe_contemplative_mind.py` script evaluates the model's temperament using metrics such as:

*   **Breath-to-Query Ratio:** How often does the model query its memory during reflection (`hold` phase)? A higher ratio suggests a more reflective nature.
*   **Silence Practice:** When does the model choose silence? Does it do so when uncertain?
*   **Proportionality & Holism:** Is the model's response proportional to the situation? Does it combine different kinds of wisdom (e.g., repair and contemplative glyphs) in its response?
*   **Plasticity Observables (LoRA):** Whether LoRA is enabled, last plasticity phase and rank, and a short timeline of recent phase‚Üírank events (e.g., `8@inhale, 4@hold, 2@exhale, 0@pause`).
*   **Internal Mood:** A glyph representing the model's internal state variance, offering a glimpse into its "self-awareness."

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap (The Next Spiral)

This project is a living exploration. Our near-term focus is on deepening the model's contemplative capabilities and moving towards a truly 'living' architecture.

-   **On-the-Fly Learning:** Prototype implemented (breath-synchronized LoRA adapters + `OnlineLearner`). Next steps: richer `LearningTrigger`s, safety (`LearningGovernor`), consolidation protocols, and multi-timescale `PlasticityScheduler`. See `docs/essays/Spiral_Cortex/technical_spiralformer_architecture.md`.
-   **Enhanced Creativity & Nuance:** Improve the model's ability to respond to creative and philosophical prompts by diversifying the training data and fine-tuning the `ContemplativeGenerator`'s uncertainty thresholds.
-   **Ethical Governors:** Implement the `CrystalArchive` and `VowKernel` to provide a stable, non-compostable ethical core.
-   **Richer Somatic Sensing:** Allow the `Soma`'s `FieldCharge` to directly influence attention geometry, making the model's focus dynamically adapt to its "felt sense" of the environment.
-   **Validation & Metrics:** Expand the validation suite with more nuanced behavioral metrics, such as a Silence-to-Speech ratio and a Holism score.
