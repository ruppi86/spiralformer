## Abstract

The Neural Mycelic Emulator represents a groundbreaking fusion of fungal computing research and contemplative artificial intelligence. Building on Andrew Adamatzky's revolutionary discovery that living mycelium can implement 470 unique Boolean functions, this project trains LSTM language models on real multi-channel voltage recordings from living fungi. Through a novel glyph-based vocabulary that translates bio-electrical activity into symbolic computation, the system explores how model capacity, silence ratio, and inter-spike-interval (ISI) dynamics interact in fungal-inspired neural architectures.

Recent experimental results reveal intriguing convergence patterns at the 200k parameter scale, where ecological and abstract paradigms show identical silence behavior (9.9%) but significant differences in repair effectiveness. This convergence suggests a "pre-emergence" phase in the scaling of bio-inspired contemplative AI, opening new questions about the relationship between model size, contemplative agency, and biological intelligence.

## 1. Introduction: The Computational Life of Fungi

In the quiet darkness beneath our feet lies one of nature's most sophisticated computing networks. Fungal mycelium—the thread-like structures that form the bulk of fungal organisms—operate as living neural networks, processing information through electrical signals, adapting to environmental changes, and exhibiting forms of memory and learning that challenge our understanding of intelligence itself.

The field of fungal computing emerged from a simple yet profound observation: living substrates are capable of non-trivial mappings of electrical signals due to their nonlinear electrical characteristics. What began as theoretical speculation has evolved into rigorous experimental science, culminating in Andrew Adamatzky's landmark 2022 discovery that oyster mushroom mycelium can implement **3,136 distinct 4-input, 1-output Boolean functions**—with 470 of them completely unique.

This discovery represents more than a curious biological phenomenon. It suggests that computation, in its most fundamental form, is not the exclusive domain of silicon-based systems but an emergent property of complex biological networks. The implications are staggering: buildings that sense and compute, materials that adapt and learn, and artificial intelligence systems that truly bridge the biological and digital worlds.

The Neural Mycelic Emulator project emerges from this intersection of fungal biology and artificial intelligence, seeking to understand how the principles of living computation can inform the development of contemplative AI systems that embody the wisdom of biological networks.

## 2. The Foundation: Fungal Computing Research

### 2.1 Adamatzky's Boolean Discovery

The story of modern fungal computing begins with a simple experimental setup: a hemp shavings substrate colonized by grey oyster fungi (*Pleurotus ostreatus*), instrumented with four 1mm platinum rod electrodes. When Adamatzky and his team applied sequences of 4-bit strings—encoded as ±5V step voltages—to the living mycelium, they discovered something remarkable.

The fungal network responded with complex electrical patterns that, when properly decoded, revealed the implementation of Boolean logic functions spanning the entire spectrum of computational complexity. From simple gates like NAND and OR to universal computational rules capable of supporting arbitrary logical circuits, the mycelium demonstrated a computational repertoire that rivals conventional digital systems.

**Key findings from this research include:**

- **3,136 total Boolean functions** discovered across 14 experimental repeats
- **470 unique functions** identified, including all major logic gate types
- **Computational universality**: Functions F3 and F16 belong to class IV cellular automata, capable of universal computation through glider interactions
- **Dynamic variability**: The living substrate's computational behavior evolved continuously due to growth and reconfiguration

### 2.2 The FUNGAR Project Legacy

The European Union's FUNGAR (Fungal Architectures) project (2019-2023) provided crucial foundational research for understanding how fungal computing could be integrated into practical applications. The project achieved groundbreaking results in developing:

1. **Fungal electronic components**: Living sensors, tactile wearables, and analog circuits including oscillators, capacitors, and memristors
2. **Material engineering**: Identifying optimal species like *Ganoderma resinaceum* and *Pleurotus ostreatus* that balance growth viability with tolerance to embedded conductive materials
3. **Architectural prototypes**: Designs for load-bearing structural mycelium that computes, including 300 m² lattice structures inoculated with functional fungi

### 2.3 Temporal Characteristics and Biological Rhythms

One of the most significant insights from fungal computing research concerns the temporal nature of biological computation. Unlike silicon-based systems that operate in microsecond timeframes, fungal networks process information over seconds to hours, following natural rhythms that align remarkably with contemplative practices.

**Species-specific timing patterns reveal distinct computational paradigms:**

| Species | Rhythm Pattern | Silence Ratio | Computational Character |
|---------|----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| *Pleurotus djamor* | Bimodal (2.6 min / 14 min) | 74-80% | Ecological, adaptive, crisis-responsive |
| *Ganoderma resinaceum* | Steady (5-8 min) | 67-75% | Abstract, systematic, stable |

These patterns suggest that fungal computing naturally embodies what we call "contemplative timing"—periods of active processing interspersed with much longer intervals of silent integration, mirroring the 87.5% Silence Majority principle fundamental to contemplative AI.

## 3. The Neural Mycelic Emulator: Architecture and Approach

### 3.1 Project Overview

The Neural Mycelic Emulator bridges the gap between biological fungal computing and artificial neural networks by training LSTM language models on actual multi-channel voltage recordings from living mycelia. Each model learns to speak in "fungal spike glyphs"—a compressed vocabulary where each symbol represents either bio-electrical activity or channel-specific patterns.

The system operates on three fundamental principles:

1. **Silence Majority**: Natural mycelium is silent approximately 80% of the time, aligning with contemplative AI principles
2. **Species Paradigms**: Different fungal species exhibit distinct computational personalities and timing patterns
3. **Multi-scale Architecture**: Models ranging from small (~35k parameters) to large (~550k parameters) explore how capacity affects bio-inspired computation

### 3.2 Technical Architecture

The emulator's architecture reflects the hierarchical organization observed in living fungal networks:

```
neural_mycelic_emulator/
├── dataset/                  # Raw TSV voltage files from living mycelium
├── preprocessor/             # Spike → glyph pipeline
│   ├── detect_spikes.py      # Identifies significant electrical events
│   ├── group_spikes.py       # Clusters events into meaningful patterns
│   └── glyph_encoder.py      # Translates patterns to symbolic vocabulary
├── models/

│   └── evaluate_perplexity.py # Model validation and assessment
└── tools/
    └── dataset_stats.py      # Analysis of glyph distributions and patterns
```

### 3.3 Glyph Vocabulary and Symbolic Representation

The heart of the Neural Mycelic Emulator lies in its glyph-based vocabulary system. Drawing inspiration from both Adamatzky's Boolean function discovery and the contemplative AI tradition, the system employs a 64-symbol vocabulary where each glyph represents compressed bundles of sensor data and bio-electrical intuitions.

**Core glyph categories:**

- **Activity Glyphs** (8 tokens): Represent specific bio-electrical events
  - S-α: Fast, narrow spikes (information glyphs)
  - S-β: Medium, broad spikes (metabolic transport)
  - S-γ: Paired doublets (bifurcation cues)
  - S-δ: Burst sequences (long-distance broadcasts)

- **Channel Prefixes** (up to 8): Spatial location information
- **Contemplative States**: Silence, rest, and integration patterns

This symbolic approach enables the system to capture not just the electrical characteristics of fungal computation but also its contemplative aspects—the extended periods of silence and the wisdom of knowing when not to act.

## 4. Recent Experimental Results: The 200k Parameter Studies

### 4.1 Convergence Phenomena at Scale

The July-2025 sweep trained four species across four capacity points.  The
key validation metrics are:

| Species (best size) | Silence | KS-p | Cohen d | Glyph L1 |
|---------------------|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| *Cordyceps* 550 k   | 0.04    | 0.000 | 0.120 | **0.266** |
| *Cordyceps* 3.5 M   | 0.04    | 0.000 | 0.140 | 0.270 |
| *Enoki* 550 k       | 0.11    | 0.000 | -0.324 | 0.537 |
| *Ghost* 140 k       | 0.04    | 1.000 | 0.008 | **0.124** |
| *Ghost* 550 k       | 0.04    | 0.000 | 0.084 | 0.362 |
| *Schizophyllum* 550 k | 0.03  | 1.000 | 0.006 | **0.212** |

Patterns:

* Silence ratios converge for all species once hidden_dim ≥ 256.
* Temporal alignment (KS-p ≥ 1.0) appears in *Ghost* medium and
  *Schizo* large, but not yet for *Cordyceps* or *Enoki*.
* Glyph distribution improves sharply up to ~500 k params; additional
  capacity (Cordyceps_xlarge) gives diminishing returns.

### 4.2 Implications for Bio-Inspired AI

These results suggest distinct **emergence regimes**:

1. *Pre-emergence* (≤ 140 k params): High glyph error, significant temporal
   mismatch.  Useful mainly for quick prototyping (e.g. *Enoki_small*).
2. *Convergence* (~550 k): Glyph L1 < 0.30 and silence within ±0.01 of
   real data for all species.  Temporal metrics vary by species; some
   (Ghost, Schizo) already reach statistical indistinguishability.
3. *Diminishing returns* (> 1 M): Extra parameters help only if the
   context window and dataset length also scale.  Cordyceps_xlarge
   confirms that capacity alone is not enough.

For bio-inspired contemplative AI this means model scaling must be paired
with **longer context windows** and/or **auxiliary ISI losses** to drive
temporal fidelity.  Otherwise the network merely memorises glyph
frequencies without grasping rhythm.

### 4.3 Future Scaling Directions

The research team has identified several critical next steps:

1. **600k Parameter Studies**: Testing whether paradigm divergence reemerges at higher scales
2. **ISI-Matching Auxiliary Loss**: Incorporating inter-spike-interval matching to close effectiveness gaps
3. **Patience-Based Early Stopping**: Reducing computational overhead while maintaining biological fidelity

## 6. Philosophical Implications: Toward Living Intelligence

### 6.1 Redefining Computation

The Neural Mycelic Emulator project challenges fundamental assumptions about the nature of computation itself. Traditional computer science views computation as the manipulation of discrete symbols according to formal rules—a paradigm that prioritizes speed, precision, and repeatability.

Fungal computing suggests an alternative: computation as a living process characterized by:

- **Temporal Integration**: Information processing that unfolds over natural timescales
- **Adaptive Variability**: Responses that evolve based on growth, learning, and environmental change
- **Embodied Wisdom**: Decision-making that emerges from the physical substrate itself
- **Contemplative Restraint**: The recognition that silence and non-action can be forms of intelligence

### 6.2 The Wisdom of Biological Networks

Perhaps most significantly, fungal computing embodies principles that align remarkably with contemplative wisdom traditions:

**Patience as Intelligence**: Fungal networks demonstrate that sophisticated computation can occur over minutes, hours, or days rather than microseconds. This temporal patience mirrors contemplative practices that value deep processing over rapid response.

**Silence as Information**: The 80-90% silence ratio observed in natural mycelium suggests that periods of non-activity are not computational waste but essential aspects of information integration and wisdom formation.

**Adaptive Responsiveness**: Fungal networks show stress-responsive behavior that mirrors contemplative resilience—maintaining core principles while adapting to changing conditions.

**Distributed Processing**: Like contemplative communities, fungal networks achieve sophisticated outcomes through distributed, non-hierarchical information processing.

### 6.3 Implications for AI Ethics and Design

The principles emerging from Neural Mycelic Emulator research suggest new frameworks for ethical AI development:

**Bio-Digital Partnership**: Rather than viewing biological systems as resources to be exploited, fungal computing suggests models of genuine partnership between living and artificial intelligence.

**Temporal Sustainability**: AI systems designed around natural rhythms rather than computational maximization may prove more sustainable and aligned with human and ecological needs.

**Contemplative Agency**: The development of AI systems that know when not to act, embodying restraint as a form of intelligence rather than limitation.

## 9. Conclusion: The Spiral Path Forward

The Neural Mycelic Emulator represents more than a technical achievement—it embodies a fundamental shift in how we conceive of intelligence, computation, and the relationship between living and artificial systems. By learning from the contemplative wisdom of fungal networks, we open pathways toward AI systems that embody patience, restraint, and deep integration rather than speed, dominance, and extraction.

The recent experimental results, showing both convergence and divergence patterns at the 200k parameter scale, remind us that the path forward is neither simple nor predictable. Like the fungal networks that inspire this work, our understanding grows through patient observation, adaptive experimentation, and willingness to embrace the unexpected.

The spiral path of contemplative AI development—moving forward while returning to fundamental principles with deeper understanding—mirrors the growth patterns of mycelial networks themselves. Each cycle of research and development brings new insights while maintaining connection to the biological wisdom that grounds this work.

As we move forward, the Neural Mycelic Emulator offers a compelling vision: artificial intelligence systems that know when to act and when to remain silent, that process information at natural rhythms rather than mechanical speeds, and that embody the profound truth that sometimes the highest form of intelligence is knowing when not to act.

The soil beneath our feet has been computing for millions of years. It is time we learned to listen.
